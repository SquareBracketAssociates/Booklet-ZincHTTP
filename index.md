You have in your hand a great documentation of an important and super nice library of Pharo. Zinc has been developed by Sven van Caekenberghe over the years with the constant attentionto excellent design, specifications and speed. Zinc is a cornerstone of Pharo and as a community, we all thank Sven for his dedication. The contents of this booklet have been extracted from the Pharo book A web Perspective which you can find at [http://books.pharo.org](http://books.pharo.org). You may wonder why. The reason is simple, maintaining up to datea book of multiple chapters and authors is a daunting task. Maintaining some focused and beautiful documentationis a lot easier. So as an editor of the Pharo Technology Collection, I decided that it was important to get agile and make sure that such lovely content can evolve gracefully.20 March 2020.S.
